Rutgers Data Sciences Bootcamp, Module 14 Challenge (30 May 2023)

This module challenge utilizes JavaScript to develop an interactive dashboard, displaying information and charts based on data regarding microbes that colonize human navels. (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/)

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

This challenge showcases the use of the following:
* Using D3 to read a JSON file
* Using D3 to select HTML elements
* Creating horizontal bar chart for current sample
* Creating bubble chart for current sample
* Showing current sample information 
* Updating charts and sample information based on user selection
